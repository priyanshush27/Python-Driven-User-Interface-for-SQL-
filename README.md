# Python-Driven-User-Interface-for-SQL-
A Python-Driven Streamlit UI integrated with MySQL, enabling non-technical users to manage inventory, sales, and operations without writing SQL. Combines advanced SQL (views, procedures, functions) with real-time dashboards, bridging backend logic and business insights through an interactive analytics tool.

# Python-Driven UI for Database Operations

## 📌 Project Vision
This project demonstrates how to build a **real-world inventory and supply chain management dashboard** by combining:
- **SQL (backend)**: advanced database operations with views, stored procedures, and functions  
- **Python (frontend)**: a Streamlit-powered interface for non-technical users  
- **Business relevance**: systems similar to those used in inventory, sales, and operations management  

The goal is to make complex database operations accessible to managers and team leads who don’t know SQL, while showcasing how backend and frontend layers work together in real-world applications.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Basic Information Dashboard**: Displays key inventory metrics and detailed tables directly from the database.  
- **Operational Tasks**:  
  - Add new products with category, supplier, and stock details  
  - View product inventory history  
  - Place reorders with quantity tracking  
  - Mark reorders as received to update stock levels  
- **Streamlit UI**: Intuitive, interactive interface for non-technical users.  
- **SQL Integration**: Uses stored procedures, views, and functions for robust backend operations.
